## Recreation Maps Application Description

The most enjoyable and affordable application for you to find your dream home. 

Through the use of three API platforms, Google Maps, Realty Mole's property API, Zomato, Recreation Maps allows individuals to find the location of their next home. The search criterion includes the property’s location, affordability, and the location’s nightlife popularity index, all in one search.

The implementation of the Google APIs provide geographical locations for potential homes in multiple locations on the website's interface.

The implementation of the Zomato API serves to provide index quality scores of the cuisine and nightlife, based on the geographic location of the potential homes.

The Realty Mole API returns property results based on the location searched. 

## Conceptualization & Motivation
With Danielle’s experience in asset management, along with the entire group’s experience in nightlife, the concept of finding a home based on the cuisine and nightlife opportunities in an area coalesced.
Although we are restricted to quarantining in our homes amidst a global pandemic, 
our team has worked hard to prepare for the celebrations that will commence once this is all over, specifically in your area!
