## Group Name: Group6 
## Project Description-
Recreation Maps 

The most enjoyable and affordable application for you to find your dream home. 

Through the use of two APIs, Google Maps and Zomato, Recreation Maps allows individuals to find the location of their next home. The search criterion includes the property’s location, affordability, and the location’s nightlife popularity index, all in one search.

The implementation of the Google API serves to provide geographical locations for potential homes.

The implementation of the Zomato API serves to provide index quality scores of the cuisine and nightlife, based on the geographic location of the potential homes.
